	<h2>Markup</h2>
    <p><span class="highlight-html">HTML</span> markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their <em>attributes</em>), character-based <em>data types, character</em> and <em>entity references</em>. <span class="highlight-html">HTML</span> tags most commonly come in pairs like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <code>&lt;img/&gt;</code>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called <em>opening tags</em> and <em>closing tags</em>).</p>
